  Hi, I'm **Thao Nguyen**, a Full-stack Web Developer passionate about building modern web applications across the entire stack. I work with both PHP and JavaScript ecosystems to deliver scalable, maintainable solutions.

  My development journey has led me to master multiple technologies on both sides of the web stack. I believe the best web applications are built with deep understanding of both frontend user experience and backend architecture.

  ### My Tech Stack

  **Backend & PHP Ecosystem:**
  - **Laravel** - Building robust RESTful APIs and MVC applications
  - **FilamentPHP** - Crafting beautiful admin panels with ease
  - **Livewire** - Creating reactive components without leaving PHP

  **Frontend & JavaScript Ecosystem:**
  - **Vue.js** - Building reactive, component-based user interfaces
  - **Nuxt** - Developing server-side rendered and static web applications
  - **InertiaJS** - Bridging Laravel backend with Vue frontend seamlessly

  ### My Development Philosophy

  My development philosophy centers on **clean code**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**. I believe great applications start with solid architecture and attention to detail. Whether I'm designing database schemas, writing API endpoints, or crafting responsive UIs, I always think about long-term maintainability and performance.

  I leverage modern development practices like version control, testing, and CI/CD to ensure quality code delivery. My goal is to write code that not only works today but can be easily extended and maintained in the future.

  ### What Drives Me

  What excites me most about web development is the ability to solve real-world problems with code. From building content management systems to crafting interactive user interfaces, each project presents unique challenges that push me to learn and grow.

  The web platform is constantly evolving, and I love staying current with new tools and best practices in both PHP and JavaScript ecosystems.

  ### Beyond Coding

  When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
