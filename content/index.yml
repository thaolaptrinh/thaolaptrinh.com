  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    As a full-stack web developer, I specialize in building modern web applications across the entire stack.

    My expertise spans both PHP and JavaScript ecosystems:

    **Backend & PHP**: Laravel, FilamentPHP, Livewire - crafting robust server-side solutions and admin panels.

    **Frontend & JavaScript**: Vue.js, Nuxt, InertiaJS - creating reactive, performant user interfaces.

    I leverage these technologies to deliver scalable, maintainable web applications that solve real-world problems.
